# ChatBot-using-GPT

In this development process, successfully integrated a GPT-2 language model into a Flask web application, creating a user-friendly chat interface with a Bootstrap-styled UI. The application allows users to interact with the GPT-2 model by entering text inputs and receiving responses dynamically.

The backend of the application is powered by a Python class, `ChatBot`, utilizing the Hugging Face Transformers library for natural language processing. We handled potential errors during the model initialization and response generation, enhancing the application's robustness. Additionally, a set of unit tests using the `unittest` module ensures the reliability of the `ChatBot` class.

The HTML frontend incorporates Bootstrap styling to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. The chat interface is presented within a centered Bootstrap card, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Users can now easily engage with the GPT-2 model through a well-designed interface.

This project serves as a foundation for building more sophisticated conversational AI applications. By understanding the integration of natural language processing models, handling errors, and incorporating modern web design principles, the application demonstrates a practical and scalable solution for interactive text-based interactions.
